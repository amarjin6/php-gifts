* ## Task 3 description
    ****
    Receiving two arbitrary sets of numbers via a POST request and combining them into one set so that the result set contains all the numbers from the first set and numbers from the second set that are not in the first (for example, if the first set there are numbers "22372", and in the second "24485", then the resulting set will contain the numbers "2 2 3 7 2 4 4 85" ("2" from the second set does not fall into the final set, because "2 ‚Äù is already in the first set).
