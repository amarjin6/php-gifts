* ## **Task 1**
An image download application that receives a URL and saves all images available at this address to a specified directory on the local disk.

* ## **Task 2**
A modified image downloading application that takes a URL and then parses that page and its subpages to form a local image directory. To make things easier, you can implement an application that works with one specific site. For example, if you select https://wallpapercave.com/categories/anime, then your application should download all anime wallpapers and sort them into directories, sections of the site of the same name.

* ## **Task 3**
An application for aggregating weather data that will collect the weather forecast for tomorrow for a specified city from at least five different weather sites and display an average temperature forecast.
