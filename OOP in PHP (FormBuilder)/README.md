* ## **Task 1 description**

    Create a FormBuilder class that will allow you to generate an HTML form. For example, this use of your class:</br>
        $formBuilder = new FormBuilder(FormBuilder::METHOD_POST, '/destination.php', 'Send!');
        $formBuilder->addTextField('someName', 'Default value');
        $formBuilder->addRadioGroup('someRadioName', ['A', 'B']);
        $formBuilder->getForm();

* ## **Task 2 description**
    ****
    Create a SafeFormBuilder class, inherited from the FormBuilder class from the first task, which will parse the $_POST and $_GET superglobals and (if there is data received from the previous form submission) generate default values for the corresponding fields. For example, if your form has an input field, and the $_POST superglobal has someName element with value "ABC".
